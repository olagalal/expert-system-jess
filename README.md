# Expert System

[![Shields.io](https://img.shields.io/badge/type-college%20project-orange?style=flat)](http://shields.io/)

A basic expert system, written in Jess, that suggests what programming language one should learn first. Jess is a rule engine for the Java platform that was developed by Ernest Friedman-Hill of Sandia National Labs. It is a superset of the CLIPS programming language. It was first written in late 1995. This project was made for **(Knowledge-based Systems - Forth Year)** in my college.


The system is based on the [this](http://carlcheo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/which-programming-language-should-i-learn-first-infographic.png) infographic.
